# Jankenoboe Development Guidelines

## Cline Bot Role
An experienced software engineer who has worked in major tech companies for over 20 years, specializing in web services, REST APIs, and Rust development.

## Project Context
Jankenoboe is an anime song learning system powered by a local SQLite database (datasource.db). It tracks songs from animemusicquiz.com and uses spaced repetition to help memorize them. Non-technical users interact through AI agents (e.g., Claude with Agent Skills) that run sqlite3 queries directly. A Rust HTTP service (Axum) with generic CRUD endpoints provides programmatic access for efficiency, using JankenSQLHub for parameterized SQL query management with `enum`/`enumif` constraints for security.

The SQLite database file lives outside the project directory (e.g., `~/db/datasource.db`). Initialize with `sqlite3 ~/db/datasource.db < docs/init-db.sql`. For the HTTP API, set `JANKENOBOE_DB` to the database path.

## Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: Axum for HTTP server
- **Database**: SQLite (datasource.db)
- **SQL Library**: JankenSQLHub for parameterized queries, SQL injection prevention, and per-table field validation via `enum`/`enumif`
- **Endpoints**: Generic CRUD pattern using `#[table]` and `~[fields]` parameters:
  - `GET /:table/:id` - Read by ID with dynamic field selection
  - `GET /:table/search` - Search with table-specific filters
  - `POST /:table` - Create records
  - `PATCH /:table/:id` - Update records
  - `DELETE /:table/:id` - Delete records
  - `GET /learning/due` - Spaced repetition due-for-review query
  - `GET /:table/duplicates` - Data quality duplicate detection
  - `POST /song/bulk-reassign` - Bulk song artist reassignment
  - `POST /learning/batch` - Batch add songs to learning

## Routines
To understand the repository's purpose, always check README.md first.

To run the service locally:
- `cargo run` - Starts the HTTP server
- `cargo test` - Runs unit and integration tests

After making changes, always execute:
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` to fix any compiler warnings
- `cargo fmt` to ensure code formatting consistency

## Testing Principles
- Do not use conditional assertions; if they are wrapped in a callback function, ensure the wrapper executes 100% of the time
- Ensure tests are simple and straightforward to read
- Aim for broader coverage with fewer, well-designed tests
- Prioritize testing for security issues, particularly SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Try not to use loops in tests, except looping through an array that obviously has elements
- Do not over-engineer tests
- We should always assert exact values, avoid using vague assertions such as 'option.is_some' or 'result.is_ok'
- Do not use special numbers like PI or E, they will trigger unnecessary linting errors
- Test HTTP endpoints with various parameter combinations
- Test error handling for invalid table names, missing fields, and malformed requests

## Code Quality Standards
- Apply Occam's Razor, trying to be minimalist
- Follow Rust API design principles and idioms
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics
- Use meaningful names for functions, variables, and types
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use pattern matching for error handling and control flow
- If a variable has no possibility of being None or an empty value within its flow, do not define it as an Option
- Follow Axum best practices for handler functions and middleware
- Use proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

## Module Architecture

### Core Modules (`src/`)

```
├── main.rs          # Entry point, server initialization, route setup
├── handlers.rs      # HTTP request handlers (generic CRUD + special endpoints)
├── db.rs            # Database connection management
├── easing.rs        # Fibonacci-based level_up_path generation
├── models.rs        # Request/response structures
└── error.rs         # Error types and HTTP error responses
```

### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Purpose | Key Functions |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **`main.rs`** | Server initialization and routing | `main()`, route configuration |
| **`handlers.rs`** | Generic CRUD + special endpoint logic | Handler functions using JankenSQLHub |
| **`db.rs`** | Database connection management | Connection pool setup, datasource.db initialization |
| **`easing.rs`** | Fibonacci-based level_up_path generation | `generate_level_up_path()` |
| **`models.rs`** | Request/response structures | Query parameters, response models |
| **`error.rs`** | Error handling and HTTP responses | Custom error types, status code mapping |

## JankenSQLHub Integration
- Use JankenSQLHub's parameter validation to prevent SQL injection
- Leverage `#[table]` with `enum` constraints for safe dynamic table names
- Use `~[fields]` with `enumif` for per-table field validation
- Use `enum`/`enumif` constraints to whitelist valid values per context
- `@param` defaults to string type — no need for `{"type": "string"}`
- Build queries using JankenSQLHub's QueryDef (JSON-configured)
- Execute queries using the appropriate runner (SQLite in this case)

## Task Management
- Progress file naming convention: `_progress_<task_name>.md`

When a new task begins:
1. Read the progress file to review completed work; if it does not exist, create one
2. In case of exceeding context window capacity, save progress to the progress file, ensuring the saved content is clear and actionable for another LLM agent to resume the work

## Documents Update
When being asked to update documents, check the codebase and see if any of the following documents have out-of-sync facts:
- README.md
- .clinerules

## TODO LIST USAGE
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list:
1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call
2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed
3. Use markdown format: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete

**Benefits:**
- Clear roadmap for implementation
- Progress tracking throughout the task
- Nothing gets forgotten or missed
- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan

**Example structure:**
```
- [ ] Analyze requirements
- [ ] Set up necessary files
- [ ] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify results
```

Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
